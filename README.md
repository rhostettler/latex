LaTeX Collection
================
This is a collection of LaTeX style files and classes for all kinds of purposes. Brief descriptions of the different packages and classes are given below; for a detailed description, have a look at the documentation, source, or template files.

**mathsym:** The mathsym package includes a bunch of commonly used mathematical symbols, operators, etc. that are not defined in any of the major mathematics package (e.g. amssym).

**parapub:** A simple class for easily creating front pages for parallel publishing of scientific articles (e.g. author's copies on personal homepages, on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), etc.) that includes the necessary copyright information. Check the [SHERPA/RoMEO catalog](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) for information on copyright policies of different publishers.

**rhsleek:** A plain and sleek presentation template (deprecated).

**ltusimple:** A simple LTU-branded presentation template (deprecated).


Installation
------------
**Linux & MacOS X:** Run the *install.sh* Bash script included in the repository. This will:

1. Install all class and style files to the $TEXMFHOME directory
2. Install all the templates (where applicable) to ~/Templates/LaTeX

**Windows:** Sorry, I can't help you here.
