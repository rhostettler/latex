LaTeX Collection
================
This is a collection of LaTeX style files and classes for all kinds of purposes. The classes are:

**parapub:** A simple class for easily creating front pages for parallel publishing of scientific articles (e.g. author's copies on personal homepages, on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), etc.) that includes the necessary copyright information. Check the [SHERPA/RoMEO catalog](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) for information on copyright policies of different publishers.

**rhsleek:** A pure and sleek presentation template.

**ltusimple:** A simple LTU-branded presentation template.


Installation
------------
**MacOS X and Linux:** Run the *install.sh* Bash script included in the repository. This will:

1. Install all class and style files to the $TEXMFHOME directory
2. Install all the templates (where applicable) to ~/Templates/LaTeX

**Windows:** Sorry, I can't help you here.
