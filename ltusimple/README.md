ltusimple.cls - LaTeX LTU Slides Template
=========================================

I. About
This is a LaTeX template for the "english with white background" LTU slides 
template. It's built on the LaTeX article class and doesn't provide fancy slide 
transitions or effects.

II. Usage
Simply copy the 'ltusimple.cls' file and the 'template' folder to the directory 
of your presentation. The example file 'ltusimple.tex' (and its compiled version
'ltusimple.pdf') are a good starting point to see how the template works.
