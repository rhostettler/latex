%% Parallel Publishing Toolbox %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% This provides some simple commands for parallel-publishing scientific papers
%% according to the rules set out by the publishers. That is, it provides an 
%% easy way to create a cover page which includes the necessary copyright and
%% citation information such that the paper can be posted on a personal or
%% institutional homepage.

%% Cover page %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% These commands are used to create the frontpage that is prepended to the. It
%% includes the paper title, authors, a full citation, copyright notice, DOI, 
%% and citation instructions.
%%
%% There are two commands to be used. The first one is \parapubsetup which is
%% preferably called in the preamble of the document. It sets the paper 
%% information (except for the title and author which are set with the default 
%% LaTeX \title and \author commands). \papersetup requires the following 
%% options:
%%
%%  journal     The journal (or conference) where the paper is (to be) 
%%              published,
%%  citationkey The key of the citation for the paper in the bibliography for
%%              including a full citation on the cover page,
%%  doi         The digital object identifier of the paper (accepted/published)
%%  copyright   A copyright notice, either your own or a predefined one (see 
%%              below),
%%
%% and one of
%%   
%%  preprint    for preprints,
%%  accepted    for accepted papers,
%%  published   for published papers.
%%
%% The second command is '\makecoverpage'. This will typeset the complete cover
%% page.
